# Example Outputs

This directory contains sample outputs for each of the NVBench examples:

- `${example}.list.md`: The output of invoking the example with `--list`.
- `${example}.md`: The output of invoking the example with `--md stdout`.
- `${example}.json`: The output of invoking the example with `--json stdout`.
- `${example}.csv`: The output of invoking the example with `--csv stdout`.

These files are only meant to provide samples of NVBench output formats. The
results and measurements in these files are not intended to demonstrate peak
performance of the devices and algorithms measured. The results may
intentionally include errors (noisy results, timeouts, etc) to show how these
are reported.

# Generating

The outputs are generated by building the `nvbench.regenerate_example_outputs`
target. Ideally, CUPTI metrics should be enabled and the GPU clocks locked
to `base`:

```bash
# Enable non-root users to collect CUPTI metrics:
sudo rmmod nvidia
sudo modprobe nvidia NVreg_RestrictProfilingToAdminUsers=0
# Enable persistence mode and lock GPU clocks to base:
sudo <any nvbench example> --pm 1 --lgc base

ninja nvbench.regenerate_example_outputs
```

The files will be written to `<nvbench_build_dir>/outputs/results/`.
